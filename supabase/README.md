# Supabase Configuration

This directory contains all Supabase-related code and configuration.

## Schema Change Policy

This repo is now **migration-first** for database changes.

- `supabase/migrations/` is the operational history of schema changes.
- Every future schema change should be captured as a migration file.
- `supabase/ddl/` remains useful, but only as a snapshot of the current expected database state.
- Do not make production-only SQL changes unless the same change also lands in `supabase/migrations/`.

Use this distinction:

- `migrations/` answers: "How does an older instance get to the current schema?"
- `ddl/` answers: "What should the schema look like now?"

### Rules for future schema work

1. Add a migration for every schema change.
2. Apply migrations to the main instance and to forks.
3. Update the corresponding `ddl/` file(s) after the migration is finalized.
4. Prefer additive migrations first, then backfill, then cleanup/removal in a later migration.
5. Avoid destructive one-step changes when forks may be behind.

### Recommended pattern for risky changes

For renames, type changes, and removals, use an expand/migrate/contract pattern:

1. Expand: add new columns, tables, policies, functions, or views alongside the old ones.
2. Migrate: backfill data and update code to use the new shape.
3. Contract: remove the old structure in a later migration.

```

**Note:** DDL files document the live database state. They are not migration scripts — keep them in sync with what actually exists in Supabase. Migration files are the upgrade path for existing instances.

## API Keys and Security Model

This app embeds a **publishable key** (`sb_publishable_...`) in `config.json` and `index.html`. This is safe by design — Supabase publishable keys are meant to be public, just like the legacy `anon` key they replace.

The publishable key identifies the *application* (not the user) and provides only basic access. The actual security comes from **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies on each table:

| Table | Anonymous access (no login) | Authenticated access (logged-in user) |
|-------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `events` | SELECT (read all) | SELECT (read all) |
| `feeds` | SELECT active sources only | SELECT active sources; admins can read and manage all source rows |
| `feed_source_reviews` | None | Admins only |
| `picks` | None | SELECT/INSERT/DELETE own rows only |
| `feed_tokens` | None | SELECT/INSERT own row only |
| `event_enrichments` | SELECT (read all) | SELECT all, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE own rows only |
| `source_suggestions` | SELECT/INSERT (anyone can suggest) | SELECT/INSERT (anyone can suggest) |
| `admin_users` | None | SELECT own row only (admin marker) |
| `admin_github_users` | None | SELECT own GitHub username row only |

So anyone with the publishable key can read events (which is the whole point — it's a public calendar). But only authenticated users can manage their own picks, and RLS ensures they can't see or modify other users' data.

For Genova, candidate source rows and their review notes are private to authenticated admins. See [Genova source review states](../docs/genova-source-review.md).

**What would be dangerous:** The `service_role` key (or `sb_secret_...`) bypasses all RLS. It must never appear in frontend code. Edge functions use it server-side via the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable, which Supabase injects automatically.

For the full explanation, see: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys

### Key types in this project

| Key | Format | Where used | Purpose |
|-----|--------|-----------|---------|
| Publishable | `sb_publishable_...` | `config.json`, `index.html` | Frontend API calls, auth initiation |
| Legacy anon | `eyJ...` (JWT) | Cron job (`05_cron_jobs.sql`), workflow | Edge Function invocation via `Authorization: Bearer` header |
| Service role | `eyJ...` (JWT) | Edge functions (auto-injected env var) | Server-side DB writes bypassing RLS |

**Why both publishable and legacy anon?** Edge Functions only support JWT verification, so the cron job and GitHub Actions workflow use the legacy anon key in the `Authorization` header. The frontend uses the publishable key. Both have the same low-privilege access level.

Find keys in: Dashboard > Settings > API > API Keys tab (publishable) and Legacy API Keys tab (anon, service_role).

## GitHub OAuth Setup

Authentication uses GitHub OAuth, coordinated between a GitHub OAuth App and Supabase Auth. Here's what you need on each side:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Click **New OAuth App**
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: e.g. `Community Calendar`
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://judell.github.io/community-calendar/`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://dzpdualvwspgqghrysyz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
4. Click **Register application**
5. Copy the **Client ID**
6. Click **Generate a new client secret**, copy the **Client Secret**

The callback URL is the critical piece — it points to *Supabase*, not your app. GitHub redirects the user there after they authorize, and Supabase handles the token exchange.

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Auth

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers
2. Click **GitHub**, toggle it ON
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from step 1
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure redirect URLs

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration
2. Set **Site URL** to `https://judell.github.io/community-calendar/` — this is the default redirect target after OAuth
3. Under **Redirect URLs**, add your app's URL(s):
   - `https://judell.github.io/community-calendar/**`
   - `http://localhost:3000/**` (for local dev via `npx serve`)
   - `http://localhost:8080/**` (for local XMLUI dev server)

These are the URLs Supabase is allowed to redirect *back to* after authentication completes. The `redirect_to` parameter in the auth URL must match one of these patterns, otherwise Supabase falls back to the Site URL.

**Important:** The Site URL must not have leading/trailing whitespace — Supabase will fail to parse it with a cryptic "first path segment cannot contain colon" error.

### How the OAuth flow works

```
User clicks Sign In
       │
       ▼
App redirects to Supabase auth endpoint
  (SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/authorize?provider=github&redirect_to=APP_URL)
       │
       ▼
Supabase redirects to GitHub
  (github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=...)
       │
       ▼
User authorizes on GitHub
       │
       ▼
GitHub redirects to Supabase callback
  (SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/callback?code=...)
       │
       ▼
Supabase exchanges code for token, creates/updates user record
       │
       ▼
Supabase redirects back to app with session in URL hash
  (APP_URL#access_token=...&refresh_token=...)
       │
       ▼
App's onAuthStateChange handler fires, stores session in localStorage
```

The app initiates this in `index.html`:
```js
window.signIn = () => {
  const returnTo = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
  window.location.href = SUPABASE_URL +
    '/auth/v1/authorize?provider=github&redirect_to=' + encodeURIComponent(returnTo);
};
```

Session is stored in `localStorage` as `sb-<project-ref>-auth-token`. To test with a different GitHub identity, use an incognito window or revoke the app at GitHub > Settings > Applications.

## Setup

### 1. Run DDL Scripts

Execute the SQL files in the Supabase SQL Editor in order:

```bash
# Or use psql if you have direct database access
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/01_extensions.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/02_events.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/03_picks.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/04_feed_tokens.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/05_cron_jobs.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/06_event_enrichments.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/08_admin_users.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f ddl/09_admin_github_users.sql

### Admin access management

Privileged UI features (for example audio capture) are gated by server-side tables, not by hardcoded GitHub usernames in frontend code.

For preapproval before first sign-in, use `admin_github_users`.

Preapprove by GitHub username:
```sql
insert into admin_github_users (github_user)
values ('judell'), ('gvwilson')
on conflict (github_user) do nothing;
```

Revoke admin:
```sql
delete from admin_github_users where github_user = 'judell';
```
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login
supabase login

# Link to the owner-created Genova project
supabase link --project-ref "$SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF"

# load-events verifies its server-only token in code. The per-function
# verify_jwt = false setting is committed in supabase/config.toml.
supabase functions deploy load-events
```

The Genova `load-events` function also checks the server-only `LOAD_EVENTS_TOKEN`
header before creating a Supabase client. Supabase's gateway JWT check is
disabled for this function only because the trusted collector is not a signed-in
user; the in-code token check is mandatory. See
[Protecting the event writer](../docs/load-events-writer-security.md) for
credential setup and rotation. No Genova backend is configured yet, so do not
deploy this function until the owner has chosen and verified one.

### 3. Set Edge Function Secrets

The `capture-event` function needs an Anthropic API key:

Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > capture-event > Secrets, or:
```bash
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## Edge Functions

### load-events (Genova fork)

Accepts authorized Genova event batches or fetches the Genova fixture from this
fork, validates the payload, and upserts into the events table. It rejects
other cities and has no fallback to `judell/community-calendar`.

```bash
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/load-events" \
  -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" \
  -H "x-load-events-token: $LOAD_EVENTS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"city":"genova","events":[]}'
```

Run this only from a trusted server environment after credentials are set; do
not use this request from a browser or commit the values.

### my-picks (v10)

Returns a user's picked events as an ICS calendar feed (default) or JSON.

```
GET https://dzpdualvwspgqghrysyz.supabase.co/functions/v1/my-picks?token=<feed_token>
GET https://dzpdualvwspgqghrysyz.supabase.co/functions/v1/my-picks?token=<feed_token>&format=json
```

Merges event data with curator enrichments (rrule, categories, notes, etc.) from the `event_enrichments` table.

### capture-event (v24)

Extracts event details from a poster image or audio recording using Claude API. Two modes:
- **Extract**: Upload image or audio, get back structured event JSON. Audio is first transcribed via Whisper, then Claude extracts event details from the transcript.
- **Commit**: Save extracted event to database and create a pick. For audio: appends transcript to description, saves transcript in dedicated column.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` secrets configured in Supabase dashboard.
